# Accelerating Phase Diagram Construction through Activity Coefficient Prediction

This repository contains all code and data supporting the paper:

## üß† Overview

This repository, alongside the main text, introduces a machine learning workfolwo to reconstruct vapor‚Äìliquid phase diagrams by training a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to map **Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff integrals (KBIs)** to **activity coefficients**.

Instead of expensive two-phase simulations, we compute KBIs from single-phase simulations and use the trained GP model to predict activity coefficients, which are then used to reconstruct phase diagrams.

### üìà Method Flow:

1. Compute RDFs from single-phase MD
2. Integrate to get KBIs \( G_{11}, G_{12}, G_{22} \)
3. Train GPR on known systems: \( [G_{ij}] \to \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \)
4. Predict \( \gamma_i \) for new systems
5. Reconstruct phase diagrams using \( \gamma_i \) and saturation pressures
