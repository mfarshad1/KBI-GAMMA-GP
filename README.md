## üß† Overview

This repository, alongside the main text, introduces a machine learning workflow to reconstruct vapor‚Äìliquid equilibrium (VLE) phase diagrams by training a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to map **Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff integrals (KBIs)** to **activity coefficients**.

Instead of relying on computationally expensive two-phase simulations, we compute KBIs from single-phase molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories and use the trained GP model to predict activity coefficients. These are then used to reconstruct phase diagrams.

### üìà Method Flow:

1. Compute RDFs from single-phase MD simulations
2. Integrate RDFs to obtain KBIs: \( G_{11}, G_{12}, G_{22} \)
3. Train GPR model using known systems: \( [G_{ij}] \to \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \)
4. Predict \( \gamma_i \) for new systems from KBIs
5. Reconstruct VLE phase diagrams using predicted \( \gamma_i \) and known pure-component saturation pressures
